# MiCM Project Match
In order to realize the potential of Computational Medicine at
McGill University, there is a need to better connect researchers
in life sciences and clinical domains with researchers and students
in the data sciences. The former has interesting datasets and
questions, while the latter can apply or develop quantitative
methods to look for solutions to these questions. MiCM Project Match
provides a database-driven, lightweight, open source web application
with the purpose of matching McGill research data projects, with
masters and doctoral students looking for interesting projects
to analyze.

## Built with
- Node
- Postgres
- React
- Redis

## Installation

Make sure nodejs, postgres & redis are installed and running.

To configure the API, copy `api/.env.example` to `api/.env` and modify the variables.
